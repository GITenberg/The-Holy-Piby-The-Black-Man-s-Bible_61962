</div>

<h3 class='c008'>CHAPTER I.<br /> THE CREATION.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. From the beginning there was God and he spake
and all things were made that are made.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The sixth day God made man for his glory, and
all things were given unto him for his possession and for
his use the woman hath God made of man and for the
glory of the man that she serve him and raise up seed
unto him.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And God rested the seventh day and hallowed it
that men should do also.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Now when the man saw the woman that was made
of him and for his glory, he loved her and married with
her, consequently she bore children unto him and they
became the father and mother of all men.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. And God called the man Adam and the woman
Eve. They were of a mixed complexion.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. And it came to pass that God commanded the man
to give names to all things that are made.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER II.<br /> DEAD BECAME ALIVE.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass that God entered the body
of an unknown dead and the dead became alive, then did
he walk about the earth in person.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. He dwelt among men and wrought many miracles
so that the kingdom of heaven might be verified.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. He suffered persecution and privation as an example
of what ministers of the gospel must suffer to
maintain the kingdom of God among men.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. And it came to pass that God gave his name Elijah,
and he called upon the name of the Lord God even
though he himself was God.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Now when the time had appeared for God to return,
the supreme angel commanded the chariot of heaven to
meet him.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. And when the chariot appeared unto Elijah, he
ascended and returned to his throne in heaven where
he reigned from the beginning and shall unto the end,
king of kings, and God of gods.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Had the men in the days of Elijah’s visit on earth
taken a right record of his administration, long before
this day the inhabitants of this earth would have known
him as God of all men.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>8. For in Elijah do the heavenly host worship as God
of the universe and in him do I, Athlyi, believe as the
only God.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. He is the Lord of righteousness and of love, an
industrious God, jealous, brave, omnipotent, omnipresent,
a king of sympathy and of justice, giver of power and
salvation, upon this God, and him only, his Law and the
Holy Ghost shall the Athlians build their church.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. We shall endeavor to please and serve him, for he
is our God. We shall worship him with all our hearts
and with all our souls, for unto us there is none so good
as the Lord, our God.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. When the Lord God of Ethiopia is with us in the
battle far that to which we are entitled, show me the
foe so powerful to set us down? Verily I say unto you
there is none.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. But who can be so good as to please the conscience
of the people that they say ye are of God?
Who will pay such a price? Will you? Then, if so, lay
down and let the public trod upon your head for a good
name.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. Verily I say unto you for this the Athlians are
bad, but on the scale of justice, let them not be found
wanting. Then shall they please the Lord God, maker of
heaven and earth, and great shall be their reward in the
Kingdom of heaven.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>
  <h2 id='AGGREGATION' class='c004'><span class='large'>THE SECOND BOOK OF ATHLYI CALLED</span><br /> AGGREGATION</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>CHAPTER 1.<br /> HEAVEN GRIEVED.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. For as much as the children of Ethiopia, God’s
favorite people of old, have drifted away from his divine
majesty, neglecting life economic, believing they should
on spiritual wings fly to the kingdom of God, consequently
became a convenient for the welfare of others.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Therefore the whole heaven was grieved and there
was a great lamentation in the Kingdom of God.
Ethiopian mothers whose bodies have been dead a thousand
years, weeping for their suffering generations and
would not be comforted.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And behold two angels of the Lord resembling
two saints of Ethiopia appeared before Athlyi and he
inquired of them what is the cry?</p>

<p class='c006'>4. And they answered him saying, Ethiopian mothers
who have been dead a thousand years pleading before
Elijah for the redemption of suffering Ethiopia and her
posterities who by the feet of the nations are trodden.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Convention in Heaven.</h4>

<p class='c010'>5. There is a great convention in heaven, saith the
angels of the Lord, unto you this day we are sent by
the Lord to felicitate, for thou art appointed shepherd
to lead Ethiopia’s generations from the oppressive feet
of the nations, and there are appointed also prophets to
prepare the way before thee.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>6. And it came to pass when Athlyi heard these
sayings he feared with great astonishment and turned
his face from the angels of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. And there appeared unto him his divine highness
Jesus Christ, Prince of the Kingdom of God, and said
quickly behold the messengers of my Father.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. At this saying Athlyi turned again to the angels
of the Lord and said, thy will be done, O God of
Ethiopia, but how can I be shepherd to lead millions
of millions even from the end of the earth when as I am
but a twig before the eyes of men?</p>

<h4 class='c009'>The Heavens Open.</h4>

<p class='c010'>9. And the angels of the Lord answered him saying,
a twig that is made by the Holy Spirit, an instrument
to lead men is great in the sight of God, over which the
armies of the earth or the hosts of hell shall not prevail.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. And it came to pass that the angel who had the
less to say lifted her eyes to heaven and stretched forth
her arms over the earth and cried, blessed be thou Ethiopia,
glory be the Father, thou Elijah, Hosanna, Hosanna
to Jehovah, praise ye Douglas the convention have
triumph.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. There appeared a beautiful light on earth and
when the light flashed Athlyi looked toward the heaven,
and behold the heaven was open and there was a great
host of saints robed in blue, millions of millions as far
as his eyes could see there was a mighty host.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>12. When Athlyi sought the angels of the Lord they
were not and he heard a voice say Athlyi and another
Athlyi, and he looked up and saw the two angels ascending
towards the celestial host.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Ethiopia Anointed.</h4>

<p class='c010'>13. And when the two messengers of the Lord were
midways they cried out unto the earth saying, blessed
be thou Ethiopia for this day thou art anointed, thou art
blest with a blessing, be ye forever united and stand up,
let the world know your God.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. And when the two angels of the Lord neared
the multitude the whole host roared with a thunder of
joy that shook the earth like a mighty earthquake.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. And it came to pass that an angel robed in four
colors came forward to receive them and the whole
celestial multitude stood and quietly formed an aisle.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. And when the two messengers appeared before
the heavenly host they bowed to the multitude and turned
themselves around and bowed also to the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. Then came forward the mighty angel robed in
four colors and placed a gold ring upon their heads, and
came forward also two mothers of Ethiopia, each with a
star in their right hand, and pinned them on the left
breast of the two messengers of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. And it came to pass that heaven and earth shook
three times and the two angels marched up the aisle and
joined with the multitude.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>Rejoicing in Heaven.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>19. There was great rejoicing in heaven and singing
hosanna to Elijah; praise ye Douglas; blessed be thou
Ethiopia forever and forever; the people at the end of
the known world, and world unknown shall look for the
coming of thy children with food and with raiment.</p>

<p class='c006'>20. And when the two angels had joined the multitude
and the mighty angel had finished his performance
the said angel who was robed in colors turned to the
heavenly host and said:</p>

<p class='c006'>21. Mothers of Ethiopia, the convention has triumphed,
your sorrows have brought joy to Ethiopia,
your tears have anointed her soil with a blessing, your
cries have awakened her children throughout the earth,
yea in the corners of the unknown world are they
aroused, and is prophesying, saying prepare ye the way
for a redeemer.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Shepherd Anointed.</h4>

<p class='c010'>22. For unto Ethiopia this day a Shepherd is anointed,
yea, as a shepherd gathers his sheep so shall he gather
unto God, the generation of Ethiopia even from the end
of the earth and lead them high, a nation among nations.</p>

<p class='c006'>23. Then shall the inhabitants of the earth know that
the Lord our God has not forsaken Ethiopia, and that
the mighty is weak against his command, and unto no
nation has he given power forever.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>24. Verily I say unto you, woe be unto the persecutors
of the shepherd for he is anointed by the Lord our God,
therefore one drop of his blood or the least of his apostles
whom he has anointed to administer the law to the generations
of Ethiopia, or the blood of a prophet within the
law, shall break to pieces the oppressors of Ethiopia.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>The Mighty Angel.</h4>

<p class='c010'>25. When the mighty angel had finished speaking to
the heavenly host he then turned to the earth and said:
Children of Ethiopia, stand, and there flashed upon the
earth a great multitude of Negroes knowing not from
whence they came; then shouted instantly the whole
heavenly host, behold, behold Ethiopia has triumphed.</p>

<p class='c006'>26. And it came to pass that the mighty angel spoke
to the multitude of Negroes, saying, woe be unto those
who say to the shepherd, thou fool, or to the least of an
apostle anointed to administer the law, for it is not the
desire of the shepherd but the will of the Lord who is God.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Dominion Over the Shepherd.</h4>

<p class='c010'>27. For as much as the Lord has dominion over the
shepherd and the shepherd over his apostles and the
apostles over all the generations of Ethiopia; then shall
the Lord our God administer to the shepherd and the
shepherd to his apostles and the apostles to all the children
of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'>28. Woe be unto an apostle who is anointed to administer
the law and neglect or deny it. Verily he shall be
cast out and the hand of the Lord shall come upon him
with sorrow and disgrace.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>29. Woe be unto those who saith I will not be united,
neither will I follow the shepherd, they shall be as sheep
without a shepherd only to be destroyed by the wolf
of the field.</p>

<p class='c006'>30. Woe be unto those who saith I hearken not to the
voice of the shepherd but go the way of the majority, for
in the majority the spirit of the Lord will not be found.</p>

<p class='c006'>31. Woe be unto those who saith I will not worship
in the house of the Lord subsidiary to the house of
Athlyi.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Purification.</h4>

<p class='c010'>32. For as much as the house of Athlyi is founded
by the holy spirit to purify the children of Ethiopia
and to administer the holy law commanded to them by
the Lord God of all mercies, that they in the end shall
be ushered in the kingdom of his Divine Majesty by
faith through consecration in love, justice and by the
pledging of life’s loyalty to a prolific and defensive cause
for the welfare of mankind. Let not the least or the
greatest of the children give a deaf ear to the saying
of the shepherd thereof, for through the mouth of the
shepherd cometh the word of the Lord to the adherents
of the Holy Law.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 2.<br /> PRESENTATION OF THE LAW.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass that the mighty angel robed
in four colors descended from among the great heavenly
host.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>2. When the Athlyi saw the angel descending he
feared with great fear and hid behind the root of a
tree.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. But the angel of the Lord came up unto him
and said, Athlyi, come forth for the Lord has made thee
shepherd of his anointed children of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. And Athlyi answered saying, who are thou? I am
Douglas, a messenger from the Lord, replied the angel.
I am sent to robe thee and to give in thy hands and in
thy care the Lord’s articles.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Verily no man shall take away that which the Lord
giveth, for the word of the Lord who is God, will not
come unto any save he who is appointed by the Father.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>Athlyi Robed.</h4>

<p class='c010'>6. The angel of the Lord robed Athlyi in four colors
and commanded him to put forth his right hand and the
messenger presented in his right hand a staff and in his
left hand the Holy Law saying, Go and administer this
law through thine apostles unto the children of Ethiopia
and command them to rise from the feet of their oppressors.
Great is the penalty if there be any failure
on your part to deliver the law; the hand of the Lord
shall come upon thee with horror and thou shalt regret
the day ye was born.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. The angel of the Lord hesitated, then said to
Athlyi, swear before the Lord God that thou wilt administer
the law unto the children; then Athlyi lifted his eyes
to the heaven and said, the heaven and earth bear witness
to my saying I will.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>8. Then the messenger of the Lord touched Athlyi
on his left breast with the first finger of his right hand
saying, be thou brave, then disappeared from the presence
of the shepherd.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 3.<br /> GOD’S HOLY LAW TO THE CHILDREN OF ETHIOPIA.</h3>

<p class='c005'>Great and manifold are the blessings bestowed upon
us the oppressed children of Ethiopia, by His Divine
Majesty, Lord God Almighty, King of all mercies, when
by his most holy command his divine highness, Christ,
Prince of the heavenly kingdom, descended and anointed
us that we may be prepared to receive these noble men,
servants of God and redeemers of Ethiopia’s posterities,
his honor, Marcus Garvey and colleague, his holiness the
shepherd Athlyi, supreme minister of God’s holy law to
the children of Ethiopia, may we show gratitude to our
God by being submissive to his teachings through these
his humble servants, and submitting ourselves in obedience
to his holy law that we a suffering people may reap
the fruit thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>When as it was the intention of others to keep us
forever in darkness, by our faithfulness to the law we
shall in time prove to the nations that God has not forsaken
Ethiopia.</p>

  <h4 class='c008'>THE HOLY LAW—COMMANDMENTS.</h4>
</div>

<h5 class='c009'>I.</h5>

<p class='c010'>1. Love ye one another O children of Ethiopia, for
by no other way can ye love the Lord your God.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>II.</h5>

<p class='c010'>2. Be thou industrious, thrifty and fruitful, O offsprings
of Ethiopia, for by no other way can ye show
gratitude to the Lord your God, for the many blessings
he has bestowed upon earth free to all mankind.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>III.</h5>

<p class='c010'>3. Be ye concretize and ever united, for by the power
of unity ye shall demand respect of the nations.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>IV.</h5>

<p class='c010'>4. Work ye willingly with all thy heart, with all thy
soul and with all thy strength to relieve suffering and
oppressed humanity, for by no other way can ye render
integral service to the Lord your God.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>V.</h5>

<p class='c010'>5. Be thou clean and pleasant, O generation of
Ethiopia, for thou art anointed, moreover the angels
of the Lord dwelleth with thee.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>VI.</h5>

<p class='c010'>6. Be thou punctual, honest and truthful that ye
gain favor in the sight of the Lord your God, and that
your pathway be prosperous.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>VII.</h5>

<p class='c010'>7. Let no people take away that which the Lord thy
God giveth thee, for the Lord shall inquire of it and if
ye shall say some one hath taken it, ye shall in no wise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>escape punishment, for he that dieth in retreat of his
enemy the Lord shall not hold him guiltless, but a people
who dieth in pursuit of their enemy for the protection
of that which the Lord God giveth them, shall receive a
reward in the kingdom of their Father.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>VIII.</h5>

<p class='c010'>8. Thou shalt first bind up the wound of thy brother
and correct the mistakes in thine own household before
ye can see the sore on the body of your friend, or the
error in the household of thy neighbor.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>IX.</h5>

<p class='c010'>9. O generation of Ethiopia, shed not the blood of
thine own for the welfare of others for such is the pathway
to destruction and contempt.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>X.</h5>

<p class='c010'>10. Be ye not contented in the vineyard or household
of others, for ye know not the day or the hour
when denial shall appear, prepare ye rather for yourselves
a foundation, for by no other way can man manifest
love for the offsprings of the womb.</p>

<h5 class='c009'>XI.</h5>

<p class='c010'>11. Athlyi, Athlyi, thou shepherd of the holy law
and of the children of Ethiopia, establish ye upon the
law a holy temple for the Lord according to thy name
and there shall all the children of Ethiopia worship the
Lord their God, and there shall the apostles of the shepherd
administer the law and receive pledges thereto and
concretize within the law. Verily he that is concretized
within the law shall be a follower and a defender thereof,
moreover the generations born of him that is concretize
within the law are also of the law.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h5 class='c009'>XII.</h5>
</div>

<p class='c010'>12. O generation of Ethiopia, thou shalt have no
other God but the Creator of heaven and earth and the
things thereof. Sing ye praises and shout hosanna to
the Lord your God, while for a foundation ye sacrifice on
earth for his divine majesty the Lord our Lord in six
days created the heaven and earth and rested the seventh;
ye also shall hallow the seventh day, for it is blessed
by the Lord, therefore on this day thou shall do no manner
of work or any within thy gates.</p>

<h4 class='c009'>The Shepherd’s Prayer by Athlyi.</h4>

<p class='c010'>1. O God of Ethiopia, thy divine majesty; thy spirit
come in our hearts to dwell in the path of righteousness
lead us, help us to forgive that we may be forgiven,
teach us love and loyalty on earth as to heaven, endow
us with wisdom and understanding to do thy will, thy
blessing to use that the hungry be fed, the naked clothed,
the sick nourished, the aged protected and the infant
cared for. Deliver us from the hands of our enemies
that we prove fruitful, then in the last day when life
is o’er, our bodies in the clay, or in the depths of the sea,
or in the belly of a beast, O give our souls a place in
thy kingdom forever and forever. Amen.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 4.<br /> THE LAW PREACHED.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. Now in the year of 1917 A. D., Shepherd Athlyi
first went about the city of Newark, New Jersey, U. S. A.,
telling of the law and preaching concretation saying, I
come not only to baptize but to concretize for the rescue
of suffering humanity, for verily I say unto you, first
seek ye righteousness toward men and all things will be
added unto you, even the kingdom of God.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>2. There came to him many to be concretized and
he concretized them with water, men and women. And
the names of his stars were: Rev. J. H. Harris, Sister
R. J. Hamilton, Brother J. Reid, Rev. and Mrs. J. Barber,
Brother C. C. Harris, Sister Leila Best, Sister Thurston,
Brother H. Pope, Rev. and Mrs. Flanagan, Brother
Charles McLaurin, Sister Letica Johnson, Brother and
Sister Adam Costly, Brother and Sister W. D. Sullivan,
Sister Sarah Johnson, Brother G. W. Roberts, Rev. J. J.
Derricks, Rev. A. J. Green, Rev. W. Barclift, Sister
Bertha Johnson, Her Holiness the Shepherdess Miriam,
Her Holiness Shepherdmiss Muriel, Brother F. L. Redd.
These are those who followed the shepherd from place
to place.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And it came to pass that his holiness, the shepherd,
traveled to Springfield, Mass., U. S. A., there he concretized
with water, and the names of his stars who followed
him around were: Sister Sylvie Randall, Brother
and Sister Eugene Kitchen, Brother and Sister Joseph
Rutherford, Rev. R. G. Gaines, Brother J. When, Sister
Ellen Fragier, Sister Minnieolo Walker, Sister M. A.
Bryant, Irene Chambers, E. Dempsey. From there he
traveled all around South America and the West Indies,
preaching of the law and concretation by water for the
sake of suffering humanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Moreover in the year of 1919 Athlyi, after he was
anointed shepherd, paraded the streets of Newark with
a host of Negroes, protected by riding officers of the
city and accompanied by a Salvation Army carrying banners,
proclaiming a universal holiday for Negroes and
foretelling of their industrial and national independence.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 5.<br /> ATHLICANITY PREACHED.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. For as much as the doctrine preached by Athlyi
gained favor in the hearts of the people, and that it was
efficient for the salvation of Ethiopia’s generations:</p>

<p class='c006'>On the thirteenth day of the seventh month, in the
nineteen hundred and eighteenth year the followers of
Athlyi assembled at the Israel Memorial A. M. E. Church,
West Kinney Street, Newark, New Jersey, U. S. A. They
declared themselves Athlyians by name and in faith:</p>

<p class='c006'>2. And they consolidated themselves within the faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. They sang songs of praises and offered thanksgiving
to the Lord God of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. And it came to pass that a committee was appointed
from among them to confirm the Shepherd, and
the names of those appointed and consolidated were Sister
Rachel Hamilton, Rev. James Barber, Sister Gilby Rose,
Bro. C. E. Harris and Bro. James Reed.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. The committee decorated the Shepherd in four
colors and committed in his right hand a staff so as to
confirm the authority conferred upon him by the heavenly
officials.</p>

<p class='c006'>6a. Now when the Shepherd was adorned and anointed
by prayer, the Athlyians shouted with great joy and cried
Lead on, Shepherd of the Athlyians.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>7b. And it came to pass after the performance, the
Shepherd stood up, and he was in four colors which were
blue, black, red and green, and he explained the meaning
of the colors and of the staff.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. Saying Ethiopia’s generations shall respect the
heaven while for a foundation they sacrifice on earth;
moreover a king sits on the throne of his organized government,
but a shepherd must seek his sheep and prepare
a pasture for them that they be fed.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Then the Shepherd commanded his followers to
stand, and he taught them saying great is his divine
majesty, the Lord God of all mankind, Father of Ethiopia;
who is greater than the Lord God? Even from the beginning
of the world hath he prepared for his children unto
the end.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. The sun, the moon, the stars, the wind, the rain,
the land and the sea hath he given free to mankind; who
is so philanthropic, so magnificent, who can give such a
gift? There is none so great as the Lord our God.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. Let all the generations of Ethiopia hear the voice
of Athlyi, for in his hands the law is given unto them.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. Let not the devil persuade you that you turn
your back against the Lord God of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. Woe be unto you should the heavenly father because
of your ingratitudes turn against thee, revengely
the hands of thy enemies shall come upon thee with
horror.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>14. Let the Athlyians walk in the path of righteousness
and all impediments shall be their foot stool and
the Spirit of the Lord shall dwell with them for ever and
ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. Blessed are the industrious hearts for they are
those who use the blessing and the power of God for the
good of mankind. Great shall be their reward in the
kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. Blessed are those who seek the Lord and by
actual work prove to the nations that they have found
him; for the power of God shall be as two kings feeling in
darkness for an electric switch and he that found it immediately
there was light throughout his palace and all the
people rejoiced because of its splendor, but in the palace
of him that found it not, there was no light, therefore his
people wandered and became the servants of others.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. Blessed are a people who seek their own, beautify
and maintain it, for in their barns there shall be plenty;
great shall they be among men. The Lord shall glory in
them and their daughters shall be the wives of mighty
men.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. Woe be unto a people, a race who seek not their
own foundation; their wives shall be servants for the
wives of other men, and their daughters shall be wives
of poor men and of vagabonds, and there shall be tears
because of privation, then in the end hell everlasting for
there shall be no reward in the kingdom of heaven for
slothful nor the unconcerned.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>19. Woe be unto a race of people who forsake their
own and adhere to the doctrine of another. They shall
be slaves to the people thereof.</p>

<p class='c006'>20. Verily I say unto you O children of Ethiopia,
boast not of the progress of other races, believing that
thou are a part of the project for at any time thou shall be
cast over the bridge of death both body and soul.</p>

<p class='c006'>21. Forget not the assembling of thyselves and
unitedly working for the upbuilding of Ethiopia and her
generations.</p>

<p class='c006'>22. Then shall the nations of the earth respect thee
and thy commodities shall be for their gold and their
commodities for thy gold, but there shall be none to fool
thee neither shall ye be their slaves.</p>

<p class='c006'>23. For thy emblem shall rank among their emblems;
thy ships among their ships and thy men of war among
their men of war; great shall be thy name among the
nations.</p>

<p class='c006'>24. The Lord God, Father of Ethiopia, shall glory in
thee, with thee shall all the angels rejoice, great is thy
reward in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>25. Thy daughters shall work with clean hands and
in soft clothing, thy sons shall enjoy the fruit of their
colleges.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 6.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. The following meeting after the Shepherd was confirmed,
there came to him men and women to be concretized,
and he concretized them with water.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. And the Shepherd taught the form Solemnityfeast,
which the Christians call sacrament, and he taught the
form of baptism also concretation and the period of
concord according to the Athlican faith.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Let the people be baptized with water by submersion
for the remission of their iniquities in the name of
one God, his Holy Law and the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Let the people be concretized also with water that
they be binded into one united band from one generation
to another and let them pledge their lives loyally to the
cause of actual work for the upbuilding of Ethiopia and
for the rescue of suffering humanity; suffer them to wash
their hands against the slothful and fruitless life of the
past.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Then shall the parson give to them a hand of fellowship,
bringing them forward into a new and ever
productive life.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Let the people assemble once a month on their
knees before the Altar at Solemnityfeast, then shall the
parson and ordained cleffs administer to them bread and
water, saying, eat in remembrance of your pledge to
God, yielding yourselves into actual work for the welfare
of your generation through the upbuilding of Ethiopia
and for the rescue of suffering humanity.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>7. Drink in remembrance of your baptism when thy
sins hath been washed away, bid far the devil and his
iniquities; arise and go in the name of one God, his Law
and the Holy Ghost.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. For as much as angel Douglas binded the heaven
and earth for the rescue of Ethiopia and her posterities,
suffer the children of Ethiopia to assemble for three days’
celebration, beginning from the setting of the sun on
the twenty-ninth day of the seventh month unto the setting
of the sun of the first day of the eighth month of
the year, which shall be known throughout the world as
the period of concord in accordance with the celestial and
terrestial concord led by the mighty angel Douglas.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Hear, oh generations of Ethiopia, for I, Athlyi,
speak not as a mere man but with authority from the
kingdom of God.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. Verily, I say unto you, the first and second days
of the concord thou shall not eat the flesh of any animals,
nor large fishes, neither shall ye drink of their blood or
of their milk; thy victuals shall be of fowl and tiny
fishes; devote thyself in communing with the Lord God
of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. Be aware of improper conduct, for the angels of
heaven are participating in the concord.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. On the third day, which is the last day of concord,
let there be a great feast and joviality among the people.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>13. Let the atmosphere be teemed with balloons of
colors carried in the hands of the people; let also the
possessions of all Ethiopia’s generations be adorned with
the colors.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. During the concord the house of Athlyi shall
order the release of the people from all Athlican factories,
or other enterprises so that they can commune
with the Lord their God.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. In time of concord let the Athlican ships fly the
colors of the Great Negro Civilization wheresoever they
are; pray that the captains thereof are of the Athlican
faith so as to celebrate concord in its fulness.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. Hear ye, O’ generations of Ethiopia, for I, Athlyi,
speak unto you, for as the Lord God of Ethiopia liveth,
this is a serious affair which must not be forsaken.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. The Holy finger print of the Almighty God signed
the issue in the name of his Majesty, his Law, and for the
sake of suffering humanity.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. And it came to pass that one of the new comers
into the Athlican faith who sat in the midst of the audience
spake, saying, may I ask his holiness, what is the
principal belief of the Athlians.</p>

<p class='c006'>19. Straightway the Shepherd answered saying, the
fundamental belief of the Athlican faith is justice to all,
but hear ye, also, the Athlian’s creed:</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>
  <h4 class='c009'>THE ATHLIAN’S CREED.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c010'>20. We believe in one God, maker of all
things, Father of Ethiopia and then in his Holy
Law as it is written in the book Piby, the sincerity
of Angel Douglas and the power of the
Holy Ghost. We believe in one Shepherd Athlyi
as an anointed apostle of the Lord our God, then
in the Afro Athlican Constructive Church unto
the most Holy House of Athlyi. We believe in
the freedom of Ethiopia and the maintenance
of an efficient government recorded upon the
catalog of nations in honor of her posterities
and the glory of her God, the establishment of
true love and the administration of justice to all
men, the celebration of concord, the virtue of the
Solemnityfeast and in the form of baptism and
concretation as taught by our Shepherd Athlyi.</p>

<p class='c006'>We believe in the utilization of the power
and blessings of God for the good of mankind,
the creation of industries, the maintenance of
colleges and the unity of force, then in the end
when earth toil is over we shall be rewarded a
place of rest in the kingdom of heaven, there to
sing with the saints of Ethiopia, singing Hallelujah,
hosanna to the Lord our God for ever and
ever—Amen.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>21. Then the Athlians shouted hosanna to the Lord
God, surely the Lord has sent us not only a Shepherd
but a saviour.</p>

<p class='c006'>22. Straightway the Shepherd Athlyi spake saying
upon those words the Afro Athlican Constructive
Church stands firm over which the hosts of hell nor the
armies of the earth shall not prevail.</p>

<p class='c006'>23. And the Shepherd being full with the Holy Spirit
recited from his heart saying:</p>

<p class='c006'>24. Father, thou God of all, closer to thee even
though afar we stray; thou hast called us back, now all
in one we come, children of Africa: Closer, oh God, to
thee; closer to thee.</p>

<p class='c006'>25. And he began to tell his followers about the wonderful
works of God; how he hath sent apostles of the
twentieth century, to save Ethiopia and her generations
from the oppressive feet of the nations that they prove
themselves fruitful for the good of their children and
the glory of their God.</p>

<p class='c006'>26. Know ye that I am not the only one sent by the
Lord our God to rescue the children of Ethiopia, for
before me there were two others sent forth to prepare
the minds of the people for the great things that shall
come to pass.</p>

<p class='c006'>27. I saw an angel resembling a mighty Negro, and
upon his head were horns of a great structure and on his
breast was a map of life.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>28. I heard a great voice uttered from the end of the
world saying, behold the map of the new Negroes, by this
shall ye know the apostle of the twentieth century whom
the Almighty God hath commanded to save Ethiopia and
her posterities.</p>

<p class='c006'>29. At the sound of the mighty voice the structure
descended from the head of the angel and stood upon the
ground and the map surrounded it, then was the writing
plain to be understood.</p>

<p class='c006'>30. And the Shepherd showed the people a copy of
the map, and said behold the map as I have seen it,
straightway at midnight I reproduce the mystery.</p>

<p class='c006'>31. Then the Athlians shouted for joy and the Shepherd
spake with a loud voice saying thou sun that shines
upon the waters of the utmost world, that gives light to
the earth, stand thou still over mountains of Africa and
give light to her righteous armies.</p>

<p class='c006'>32. Where are those; there is none to compare with
the Athlians in united spirits and a determination; a
people lovers of freedom and of justice, fearless of death.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 7.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. Now in the year of nineteen hundred and nineteen
on the thirtieth day of the seventh month, when the
Athlians were celebrating concord in the city of Newark,
New Jersey, U. S. A., and on the third day of the period
a paper was read by the Rev. Bonfield telling of Marcus
Garvey in New York City.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>2. And the Shepherd hesitated, then spake, saying:</p>

<p class='c006'>3. I almost believe this is one of the apostles of the
twentieth century, but where is the other? for I look
for two, however by the map of life I shall know him.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Raise not the weight of your finger on Marcus
Garvey, neither speak ye against him.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. In the year of 1921 Garvey spake, saying: I have
no time to teach religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Because of this saying Athlyi took up his pen
and was about to declare him not an apostle of the
twentieth century.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. And it came to pass that the word of the Lord
came to Athlyi saying, blame not this man, for I the
Lord God, hath sent him to prepare the minds of Ethiopia’s
generations, verily he shall straighten up upon the
map.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. Nevertheless, in the year nineteen hundred and
twenty-two Apostle Garvey issued a religious call
throughout the world which fulfilled the last item upon
the map of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Therefore, Athlyi yielded him a copy of the map,
and declared Marcus Garvey an apostle of the Lord God
for the redemption of Ethiopia and her suffering posterities.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. And the word of the Lord came to Athlyi saying,
I am the Lord God of Ethiopia, three apostles of the twentieth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>century have I sent forth unto Ethiopia’s generations
to administer the Law and the Gospel which I have
commanded for their salvation, let not the hands of men
ordain them.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. For I, the Lord, hath anointed mine apostles that
they may ordain and give authority to ordain.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 8.<br /> ATHLYI SENT ABROAD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came
to Athlyi saying get thee into foreign countries and
provide stars of the Law and of the gospel of the twentieth
century.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Go the way of the Atlantic and return by way of
the Pacific, and Athlyi obeyed the Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And when he was in the Strait of Magellan, the
Lord spake to him saying:</p>

<p class='c006'>4. My holy house of Athlyi let her be of two wings,
the Church to the right and a green pasture to the left.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Let the Church teach and the green pasture to
provide for the people; let the house of Athlyi be the director
thereof, and I, the Lord, shall dwell in the house
of Athlyi and give light to her wings, then shall the inhabitants
of the earth know that I am the Lord God of
Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Let there be but one church or denomination upon
the law and the gospel commanded for the salvation of
Ethiopia’s generations.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. In entering the inner door of the Church let the
people bow with reverence to the holy dictuary.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. Suffer no one to preach upon or in the dictuary
save a teacher of the law and a believer in the gospel
commanded to the children of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>9. Let the people take interest in the apostles, but
he that boost not the green pasture to provide for the
people is not worthy of compensation.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. Let the people give to the green pasture for their
own good and for the welfare of their generations.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. Oh, Athlians, love ye one another, forget not the
assembling of yourselves together that no corruption
gather between thee, for thou art the light and guide
unto salvation; let all the children of Ethiopia follow
thee.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. May the Lord God of Ethiopia watch between
us whil’st we are absent one from another. May he endow
us with unity of spirit and anxious hearts to again
assemble for the rise of falling humanity through the
guidance of the house of Athlyi and in the name of one
God, his Law and the Holy Ghost for ever and ever—Amen.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 9.<br /> THE WORD OF THE LORD.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass in the year of nineteen hundred
and twenty-four and the twelfth day of the ninth
month, the word of the Lord, God of Ethiopia came to
Athlyi saying,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. “I am God, the creator, father of Ham, Canaan,
Nimrod and Ethiopia.”</p>

<p class='c006'>3. “Why calleth thou my holy temple, Church?” sayeth
the Lord unto Athlyi.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. “Will thou also destroy the righteousness, of my
holy name?”</p>

<p class='c006'>5. “Will thou even so teach that I am a God who confers
honor upon the envious in mind; the lying, inhuman,
murdering, plunderous, oppressive and adulturous
characters in my name?”</p>

<p class='c006'>6. And the Lord continued to say, “Athlyi! Oh Athlyi!
I say unto you again. Why calleth my holy temple,
‘Church’? Will thou also teach that I have commanded
to destroy the offsprings of Ham in Canaan?”</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Athlyi answered saying, “Father, behold the
House of Athlyi.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>8. “This I have created,” saith the Lord, “Verily I
shall dwell in the High place at the House of Athlyi
and shall give light to the Shepherd and the Shepherd
to his Apostles and his Apostles to all people who shall
constitute the auxiliaries of my most holy House of
Athlyi.”</p>

<p class='c006'>9. “But why calleth thou these auxiliaries, ‘Church’?”
he continued.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. Athlyi hesitated and the Lord our God, who
stood in the midst of a brilliant light, like unto a circle
pointed to Athlyi and said,</p>

<p class='c006'>11. “I have commanded thee but thou art carried
away by those who polluted the righteousness of my
name.”</p>

<p class='c006'>12. At this saying Athlyi advanced towards the Lord
with open arms and cried out, “O God of Ethiopia, I
pray, redeem me, wash me clean and separate me from
all gospels that pollute the righteousness of thy name
that those in me unto thee may be clean and free from
all things abominable in thy sight.”</p>

<p class='c006'>13. “Thou art the supreme sage; pray! Give me to
nurse at thy breast the milk of wisdom that I may
know and understand thee.”</p>

<p class='c006'>14. And it came to pass that the Lord, our God of
Ethiopia spoke saying, “Reach out and touch me.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>15. Athlyi reached out and with the first finger of
his right hand touched the personality in the light,
straightway his heart became in motion and the eyes
of Athlyi lit up like a torch. Evidently he had increased
in wisdom, a man matchless in spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. And the Lord, God of Ethiopia, spoke unto Athlyi
saying, “Thou art a star in my crown. Go ye through
the lands that men may dwell in thee and see clear the
impediments in the paths of their lives.”</p>

<p class='c006'>17. Now when the Lord has commanded Athlyi to
carry the light unto others he departed and the light
of his eyes lit up the near and distant darkness, and the
word of his mouth brought freedom to the enslaved.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 10.<br /> REJOICING IN THE LIGHT.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass on the following day the Lord
called Athlyi; and when Athlyi appeared before the
Lord, the light of his eyes connected with the light that
surrounded the divine personality.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. And there appeared a light matchless in its beauty.
Straightway the whole celestial host shouted and
there appeared millions of Angels dancing in the light
singing, “Behold! Behold Ethiopia! The bride of the master.
Her day has come at last! The Lord has received
her hand. Her night has forever passed.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>3. The Lord stretched forth his hands over the earth
and there appeared millions of black men, women and
children, who joined with the angels in dancing, singing
and rejoicing in the light.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Again did the Lord stretch forth his hands over
Ethiopia and Canaan and the offsprings of Ham became
mighty and the lands became prosperous in animals,
fruits and grains. Great cities sprang up among them
and the women as well as men mastered ships upon the
waters.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. And Athlyi looked and beheld great industries
sprung up among the children of Ethiopia and he saw
men kissing the women and praising them because of
their mighty task in the struggle. He beheld women
worshiping men because they had made them great.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. And the Lord, our God, spoke unto the children,
his voice echoed from Ethiopia to Canaan saying,</p>

<p class='c006'>7. “Blessed are the mighty in righteousness for they
shall be respected.”</p>

<p class='c006'>8. “Blessed are the wealthy in love for I am rich
and whosoever believeth in Athlyi and in the gospel
which I have commended through him seeketh after
these things which are in me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>9. “And I the Lord shall fill him to the brim and
make his a power over which no hell shall prevail.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>10. “But he that is contented in poverty and weakness
shall be weaker and poorer; a foot stool of the nations;
for he represents the devil, in him there is no
God.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. “The fool impoverishes himself to find me. Verily
I say unto you, he shall not find me,” saith the Lord,
“for I am rich.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“But whosoever believeth in Athlyi seeketh my principle,
therefore I shall reach out my hand and help
him to be as I am.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 11.<br /> RETURNED TO NEWARK.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass that the word of the Lord,
God of Ethiopia, came to Athlyi saying,</p>

<p class='c006'>2. “Arise in the morning, break not your fast, neither
say ye a word to anyone. And thou shall return to Newark
and I will go with thee and thou shall see me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>3. “When thou shall have come to Newark prepare
there a house, substitary to the House of Athlyi, where
the children of Ethiopia shall assemble before me in
united worship. I shall reach out my hands and bless
them with increased blessings and they shall go forth
as Athlians with light and power, modeling all men
according to my righteous principles,” saith the Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>4. The Lord spake saying, “I will march with the
Athlians, I will pilot them, and stear them. I will recharge
them and I, through their Shepherd, shall command
them. Verily, there shall be no halting until they
have conquered the Devil, banished his Hell and reconstructed
the earth upon my righteous and clean principles.”</p>

<p class='c006'>6. “Then shall there be no prejudices, no illmosity
among men, but peace, tranquility and good will upon
the earth, recognizing the divine fatherhood of God,
the brotherhood of man and the rights of each and
every one to enjoy equally the blessings of the father.”</p>

<p class='c006'>7. And the Lord, God of Ethiopia, charged Athlyi
saying, “Call not my holy house ‘Church,’ neither shall
thou permit unjust literature which teaches that God
has commanded Israel to oppress, rob and destroy the
offsprings of Ham in Canaan to rest upon my altar, for
I have no part in such Deuteronomies. They are an
abomination in my sight, and a disgrace upon the earth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>8. And the Lord continued, “I shall bring to an end
the oppressors of Ham. I shall tear down the walls which
I have permitted to hold Ethiopia in bondage, that she
may know the devil and his unrighteousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. “Never-the-less, the children of Ethiopia, even unto
this day, walketh upright before me, save those
whom I the Lord, God have suffered to be spoiled by the
enemies, that they might know the evil against the posterities
of Ham.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>10. “Now I shall send forth an army of Athlians
who shall redeem my children and deliver them again to
my arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. “I shall nourish them. Their chest shall be as
unbreakable steel. Their legs as giant reenforced concrete.
Hearts of understanding and heads matchlessly
wise. They shall be my masons, builders of a righteous
kingdom and the source of salvation for all,” saith the
Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. “For I am God, the creator of all. All things
I hold in my hands and giveth freely unto him that
walketh in me.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. “Whosoever seeth an Athlian, seeth me, for I
am in him and he is of me. Whosoever followeth an
Athlian followeth me also,” saith the Lord.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. And when the Lord had spoke these things Athlyi
turned and asked, “Father, what shall I call Thy
holy house?”</p>

<p class='c006'>15. And the Lord spoke to Athlyi saying, “Go and
do as I have commanded you. The mouth of a child
shall reveal the name, moreover, I shall write it upon
the wall and you shall see it.”</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 12.<br /> THE GUIDING LIGHT.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. Now when Athlyi started for Newark, there appeared
a spotlight on the sleeve of his coat.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. When Athlyi saw the light he tried to cover it
with his hat but the light could not be covered.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Then he looked up and yelled joyfully, “It’s the
light of the Lord. Surely it cannot be covered. The
light of the Lord our God I shall follow this day. Indeed
I will not stray.”</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Athlyi journeyed to Newark and the light with
him.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. But when he turned contrary to the will of God,
the light would not follow but stood on another street.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Now when Athlyi saw the light would not go he
turned and went the way the light pointed him.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. And it came to pass when Athlyi reached the city
of Newark he prepared a house for the Lord our God
and when he was making ready for the first sermon,
a little girl opened the door and stared plumply into his
face and uttered “Gaathly”. “Is your name Gaathly?”
the Shepherd asked.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>8. The child then raised her voice and again said
“Gaathly,” and went out.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. Straightway a light flashed and Athlyi looked around.
He beheld over the altar a hand, writing on the
wall the name Gaathly.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. When Athlyi saw the hand on the wall he became
very fearful but embroiled with joy.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. He then rushed into the inner chamber and proclaimed
before his wife Miriam and his daughter Muriel,
the name of Gaathly saying, “Behold, a hand wrote
it and the child revealed it as the Lord had promised.”</p>

<p class='c006'>13. From that day unto this the holy house founded
upon the Gospel of God through Athlyi is known as the
Gaathly.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 13.<br /> ATHLYI BLEEDS.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass on the third Saturday night
of the seventh month of the year nineteen hundred and
twenty-seven, the word of the Lord came to Athlyi saying,
“Tomorrow, thou shalt with thine own blood set
apart the Athlians from the rest of the world’s inhabitants,
that I may glory in them and nourish them.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. “I shall send my angels and they shall dwell among
the Athlians and teach them new things. Verily,
the women as well as the men shall develop great in
science.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>3. “Fear not, because of the inventions of today,”
saith the Lord, “for greater shall come out of my people,
the Athlians. They shall school Ethiopia. Consequently
the sons and daughters of Ham shall be a burning
light unto all the earth.”</p>

<p class='c006'>4. On the next day which was Sunday, while the
Shepherd Athlyi preached before the people who came
out to Gaathly, the spirit of the Lord came upon him
and he then bit the top of his fingers, so that the blood
spouted.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Then with his blood he marked a line between the
Athlians and the rest of the earth’s inhabitants as the
Lord had commanded him.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Then came forth the Shepherdmiss Muriel, daughter
of Athlyi, who fell upon her knees saying, “Let thy
blood fall upon me that I bear it through the ages.”
The Shepherd let his blood fall upon her.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. Then came forward also Sister Mary Howard, stear
of the nourishers and saints. She bound up the Shepherd’s
wound.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. “I am a witness of this blood,” the Stear uttered,
but the Shepherd answered saying, “All Athlians are witnesses
of this blood, and I shall be their Shepherd forever.
Even in the spirit I shall be with them and I
shall be quick to answer those who called upon me in
sincerity; but those who seeketh me empty in heart shall
not find me.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>10. “Happy shall be the aged who sacrifice the days
of His youth within this blood. His tree shall grow
mighty in the green pasture. He shall not want, but
flourish.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. “But verily I say unto you, only through concretation
can anyone come beyond this blood and become
an Athlian.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. “For unto the Athlians, there is but one God,
one Law, and one Shepherd.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. “I am the lover of Justice, the light and guide
unto perfect salvation,” saith Athlyi.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. “Whosoever believeth in me shall in life enjoy
salvation and inherit eternal happiness in the kingdom
of God who sent me.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. “But he that believeth not in me shall be a
victim of slavery and oppression at the hands of Europe
all the days of his unbelief.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. “For he that receiveth me not, his heart despiseth
the gift of God, the father, who sent me.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. “For thus saith the Lord our God, ‘I shall not
send Japeth to Ham, neither will I send to Sham, Japeth.
But in time of peril I shall appoint from among
them a saviour whose word shall reign forever.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>18. “‘They that refuseth their own in me, shall find
no other. But slavery and oppression shall overcome
them. They shall live in disgrace and die in dishonor!</p>

<p class='c006'>19. “‘For I am the almighty powerhouse,’ said the
Lord, ‘the spring of salvation, but a people without a
king has no connection with me.’</p>

<p class='c006'>20. “Fear not, O ye Athlians, for I, Athlyi, am your
Shepherd. I am not of the flesh but of the spirit of
God, the Father, who sent me to gather the children of
Ethiopia that they be saved from peril. In the bosom of
the Lord I shall forever hold my grip, therefor thou
shalt be an everlasting light and power upon the earth.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 14.<br /> HEAVEN AND HELL.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass that the spirit moved in
Athlyi and he became full with the holy ghost.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. And he cried out saying, “Hear me, O children
of Ethiopia. There is not a heaven nor a hell but that
which ye make of yourselves and for yourselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. “In heaven there are few while in hell there are
many. But those who are in heaven are the champions
of time who have conquered over sin and slothfulness.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>4. “The fool slights the things in life and seeketh
heaven after death. Verily, Verily I say unto you, he
shall not find it. But the spirit of him that establishes
a heaven on earth shall dwell in heaven everlasting.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. “Unto him that is empty in love, faith, righteousness
and industry there is no heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. “Heaven is a splendor. A source of peace and
happiness, where the spirit of God is visable in its appearance.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. “He that passeth from this heaven is exalted into
heaven eternal. Beyond strife and death, where pain
and sorrows are unknown.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. “Hell is a dark and shabby place; a den of thieves,
murderers, gamblers, drunkards, liars, blasphemers,
hypocrites, underminers, voodoers, fortune tellers, begrudgers,
raggedmen, yellers, backsliders, lazymen, deceivers,
loafers, jormandizers, leppydoes, hoers, hoerlets,
poverty, lice and diseases.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. “Consequently the victims of the devil eat the
fruit of the tree they have sown and therefore live in
disgrace among men.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. “Woe be unto the spirit of him that passeth
from this hell. He shall be lowered into eternal hell
where peace and happiness are unknown.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>11. “He that is of the devil shall be segregated from
the children of God; but he that is of God weareth the
badge of the master, and the doors of heaven shall be
opened unto him.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. “Lo, I heard a cry in hell,” saith Athlyi, “calling
upon me in God.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. “And I looked and beheld a man striving to
conquer hell and escape from his horrible condition.”</p>

<p class='c006'>14. And Athlyi spoke unto his saying, “Who art
thou?”</p>

<p class='c006'>15. “‘I am Amos who persecuted thee and lied about
you. Now I would rather be a sweeper in the Gaathly
than to be a prince in the palace of kings who believeth
not in thee.’</p>

<p class='c006'>16. And Athlyi spoke unto him saying, “Thou doeth
thyself this harm for there is no hell for him who believeth
in me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>17. And Amos reached out crying, “Forgive me, O
Athlyi! and redeem me from this misery. For I believe
that thou art a man of God with power to save.”</p>

<p class='c006'>18. Then Athlyi reached down and lifted him up saying,
“Arise, and stand above the devil and his hell. Thy
faith in me shall bear thee up, but he that is weak in
faith shall fall through his faith.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>19. “For I am not of myself but of God, the father,
who is in me. He that gives himself up to me wholeheartedly,
I shall nurse him at my breast and he shall
be strong.</p>

<p class='c006'>20. “There shall be no devil to conquer him, neither
shall there be any hell to hold him; for they, that are
of me, shall help him that is in me. They that helpeth
not their brother in me are not of me; likewise he who
is not in harmony with the law of this gospel is not of
me.</p>

<p class='c006'>21. “He that cometh unto me halfway, I shall not
receive him,” saith Athlyi, “for he is weak in himself
in me and shall therefore fall in himself.</p>

<p class='c006'>22. “He that withholds from me, that which he is
able to give, shall lose it without compensation; but he
that soweth in me wholeheartedly shall reap a reward
ten fold. For I am of good soil and God, the father in
me, shall water that which is sown in me.</p>

<p class='c006'>23. “In the lives of those that are in me,” saith
Athlyi, “there is but one God, one Shepherd, and one
Gaathly. The Holy Law is of God and is God with
those in me.</p>

<p class='c006'>24. “They that are of me shall help those that are
in me. They shall march together to defend their dignity
and create projects to supply their necessities in
life.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>25. “At the sound of the bugle of war all Athlians
shall gather around their rulers. Then, at the Shepherd’s
command go forward to defend their rights.</p>

<p class='c006'>26. “Knowing that our reward is Heaven everlasting
if our enemy we shall conquer, it is therefore the
sole spirit of the Athlians to die in honor rather than
to live as dependable dogs in disgrace, subject to the
dictation of others who are not in me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>27. Then Athlyi called his Cledgers around him and
placed his hands upon the right shoulder of each saying,
“Blessed are the creators in me. They shall set with
me in heaven eternal and return with me to inspect the
earth and crown the worthy.</p>

<p class='c006'>28. “He that is not clean, industrious and thrifty
is not in me, for I am a lover of cleanness, lord of industry
and a builder of commerce, that men may be
happy in me.</p>

<p class='c006'>29. “For he that liveth a productive life in me
seeketh, and shall obtain heaven terrestrial and heaven
eternal.</p>

<p class='c006'>30. “Go ye out upon the earth, beneath the earth,
upon the waters, beneath the waters and upon the trees.
Gather in the blessings of God and develop them in me
that ye prove yourselves worthy of compensation. For
weakness and poverty is of the devil but richness and
power is of God.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>31. “But where there is no love, righteousness, and
faith in your transactions the glory of heaven shall vanish
and the misery of hell shall occupy the soul.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 14.<br /> THE BEGGAR.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass that on the twenty-eighth day
of the eighth month of nineteen hundred and twenty-seven
(according to the English years but the fourteenth
year according to the Athlican years) a young
man twenty-two years of age came into the Gaathly
begging for money.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. The Shepherd looked upon the young man and
said, “Thou art in the bloom of youth and power, but
because thou art not of me, ye must beg.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. “Go ye however through the highways and into
corners, even so behind closed doors and gather men
unto me, that they be lifted up from hell unto salvation.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. “Then shall ye not be a beggar of me, but a sower
and a reaper in me.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. “For as many as believe and walk in me shall
be saved. I shall relieve them of their miseries. I shall
banish their sorrows. I shall defend them. I shall
be a light in their darkness. I shall raise them up when
all hopes are dead.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>6. “I shall harden my heart against backsliders. The
hypocrite, the liar, and the thief, I despise.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. “Be aware of gospels that are not of God through
Ethiopia. For it shall rob and destroy as many as accept
it.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. “Verily I say unto you, he that is not of me is
not for your salvation. For I am he, whom the Lord,
God of Ethiopia, had promised thee from creation, that
ye may stretch forth thy hands direct unto the father
through me and be saved.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. “Before me there was none unto Ethiopia, but
with me there is another and you, in me, in him are

of his vein are cousins.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. “Take heed! O ye children of Ethiopia. For I,
Athlyi zigy sobcok tee. Whosoever cometh after me and
is not of me is not for your salvation, but seeketh to
destroy your civilization in God through me.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. “Prophets shall rise and wise men shall spring
out of you, but they that build not upon this foundation
in me, in righteousness are deceivers of you.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. “They shall come up to you with unjust gospels,
which seeketh to destroy the offsprings of our
father, Ham, doctrines which were before me.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>13. “But it shall be as a man pleading with an
electrician to go back to the tallow candle age, but the
electrician shall laugh him to scorn.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. “For I am greater than all gospels that were
before my coming. I am richer. I am higher. Test
me and be ye convinced that I, in the bosom of the
God of Justice, have laid a foundation sufficient to
hold all the builders that cometh after me in righteousness.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. “I shall banish the devil. I shall clear up his
hell and it shall bloom like a garden of brimigen. Then
shall the rivers of peace flow out and the children of
all the earth shall sit around the table of salvation
in the House of God enjoying in life the splendor of
true love and justice in me. For I am not myself, but
God in me unto you.</p>

<p class='c006'>16. “But verily I say unto you, I shall cut my
heaven from him that knoweth and doeth not according
to this gospel.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. “The wise will prepare for battle even though
there may not be any fight.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. “The fool will quarrel but he that quarrels with
a fool is a damn fool.</p>

<p class='c006'>19. “Hear me, O thou Athlians! Be ye wise and
live. I go to prepare a place for you beyond this heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>20. “Whosoever walketh in my blood within the
principles of this gospel shall dwell with me in heaven
everlasting, but he that walketh another way shall not
find me.</p>

<p class='c006'>21. “‘I will blow my trumpet throughout the Kingdom
of Athlyi in Africa’, saith the Lord our God, ‘and
my people the Athlians shall blow it unto the world.</p>

<p class='c006'>22. “‘Then shall the inhabitants of the earth respect
me, for I am a God of salvation, a conqueror of
evil’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>23. And it came to pass that Athlyi issued an order
saying, “A real minister of Athlicanity must bear a diploma
from the Athlican School of Athlicology and the
graduation process shall embody ordination.</p>

<p class='c006'>25. “God be with you my beloved. Let there be
unity in spirit while ye are absent one from another.
Wheresoever it is one Athlian there is the Shepherd
in him, and whatsoever heareth an Athlian heareth
also the Shepherd, and whatsoever an Athlian seeth,
seeth the Shepherd also, for the Athlians are an amalgamation
instituted by God which no man can separate.”</p>

  <h2 id='APOSTLES' class='c004'><span class='large'>THE THIRD BOOK OF ATHLYI NAMED</span><br /> THE FACTS OF THE APOSTLES</h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c008'>CHAPTER 1.<br /> APOSTLES ANOINTED.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. Just at the time when the nations of the earth
through their ill education and oppression, believed that
they had ruined the children of Ethiopia for ever, and
that they would be satisfied with the crumbs of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Behold the great God Almighty hath commanded
his angels to anoint them that they be a new and prolific
people upon the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Then did the Lord God with his own hands
ordain three apostles and sent them forth to save Ethiopia’s
generation from doom.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Now when Marcus Garvey, God’s foremost apostle,
heard the voice of his colleague, apostle Robert Lincoln
Poston, preaching in the City of Detroit, Michigan, United
States of America, he knew that this was his colleague
for the Lord God hath revealed, notwithstanding the
three apostles had met in the spirit before they came to
administer the law and gospel for the full salvation of
Ethiopia’s posterities.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. And it came to pass that apostle Garvey journeyed
to Detroit and there met his colleague and they greeted
each other with great joy, and the heart of one was the
heart of the other.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>6. Now when the amalgamation of their apostleship
was verified, apostle Poston came to New York City,
United States of America, and then teamed with apostle
Garvey in the work for the redemption of Ethiopia and
her trodden posterities, whom through the oppression of
the nations and the ignorance of the Negro ministers of
Christian faith, were hanging over the bridge of death,
both body and soul.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 2.<br /> GOD SPOKE TO HIS APOSTLE.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. Now in the year nineteen hundred and twenty-three,
the word of the Lord God of Ethiopia came to
apostle Marcus Garvey saying, where is thy colleague?</p>

<p class='c006'>2. And he answered, Father, behold he is with me.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Call together the children of Ethiopia, saith the
Lord, that they may know my request, and send forth
a mission unto the land of Ethiopia which I hath given to
her children from the beginning of the world, that they
prepare a foundation for all the posterities of Ethiopia,
even unto the end.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. For I, the Lord God, shall come to judge between
the three races of men; woe be unto the empty handed,
the slothful and the coward. I shall bring judgment upon
them with fire and with brimstone, even the baby at the
mother’s breast shall not escape, saith the Lord. Prepare
ye a bill of arrangement, saith the Lord, and give it in
the hands of thy colleague that he go to the land of
Ethiopia (Africa) and to the nations at the entrance of
the land and request them to open the door for the return
of thy children.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>5. And I, the Lord, shall go with him, and I will
touch the hearts of the nations and they shall yield to the
request.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. Then shall the children of Ethiopia return to their
own land and there establish a light with which no nation
shall compare, nor will there be any power sufficient to
douse it.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. For I am the Lord God of Ethiopia and I shall dwell
with mine anointed and they shall be my people as long as
they follow the teachings of my apostles.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. Moreover, behold at thy side is the noble woman
Henrietta in whom the whole heaven adore because of her
greatness of faith and the loyal way in which she fights
to save Ethiopia and her generations from everlasting
downfall. Place her at the side of thy colleague, for
great is her wisdom, saith the Lord, and send ye also
another that they go and prepare a home for mine
anointed.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. And it came to pass that apostle Garvey obeyed the
Lord, and he called the children of Ethiopia and there
gathered a great host in the City of New York.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. And when the apostle put before them the Lord’s
request they leapt for joy and confirmed the will of the
Lord God of Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. Then were a delegation of three sent forth according
to the words of the Lord.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 3.<br /> STANDING BEFORE ELIJAH.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass that on the night of the
fifteenth day of the third month of the nineteen hundred
and twenty-fourth year, Athlyi spake aloud, saying:</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Behold I saw the heaven draped in black, and I
saw Angel Douglas sitting in a mourning robe, moreover
the celestial saints of Ethiopia were in deep sorrow.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. And it came to pass that I continued to look, and
behold I saw a natural man standing before Angel Douglas,
and after a brief conversation, the mighty Angel conveyed
him to the throne of Elijah, God of heaven and
earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. Then upon the head of the natural man did Elijah
place a crown and on the front part of the crown there
was a brilliant star whose light extended from heaven
to the earth.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Now when the crown was bestowed upon him,
behold the mourning apparel disappeared and there was
joy in heaven.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. And it came to pass that I saw a great host of
Negroes marching upon the earth and there was a light
upon them, then I looked towards the heaven and behold
I saw the natural man standing in the east and the star of
his crown gave light to the pathway of the children of
Ethiopia.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 4.<br /> APOSTLES EXALTED.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. The following morning after Athlyi’s vision, Athlyi
looked towards the rising sun and cried out saying, my
God, my God, what shall happen to the apostles of the
Twentieth Century? Father if it’s me, even I that shall
pass from the presence of men grant that the Piby live
forever that the children of Ethiopia, through the teaching
of the Afro Athlican Constructive Church, may obtain
salvation forever.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. And it came to pass that the Lord spake to Athlyi,
saying:</p>

<p class='c006'>3. In the flesh did he go to prepare a foundation
for the generations of Ethiopia, but in the spirit will he
return to lead them there upon.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. For I, the Lord God, hath exalted him in the spirit,
Prince over the children of Ethiopia; he shall see with all-seeing
eyes; in vain shall the nations of the world lay
traps before mine anointed, for the Prince of the children
shall lead them.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. Woe be unto the proud, the hard hearted, unto
those who shall say I have my treasures here and I will
not leave them, neither will I follow the host led by the
apostles of the Twentieth Century.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. I shall bring vengeance upon them, saith the Lord,
they be better boiled in oil, for I shall have no mercy
upon them.</p>

</div>

<h3 class='c008'>CHAPTER 1</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. Now in the fifteenth year of Athlyi’s reign over
the Athlians, the spirit of the Lord came upon him.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. Being filled with the Holy Ghost he prophescied
saying, “To the sun, in the sun, with the sun and the
fuel of today shall a used to be.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. “How beautiful the ships. How powerful, but the
fuel of today shall a used to be. How speedy the airships
the world around, around and around with no
need for refuel.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. “Hot shall be the houses. The pots a-boiling and
bright the lights; but where are the wires? They used
to be.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. “The power of today is electric, but tomorrow
shall be siprick.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. “Satter, the mighty comet shall pass with the end
of her tail two miles from the earth and the roaring of
her passing, killing.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. “I heard a cry saying, ‘Where is thy scenery as a
star, O Satter. Behold thou art lands over lands. Pass
quickly for we perish beneath thee.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>8. “New lands when Satter comes back. A buggy
from Tokio to Los Angeles. A bicycle from London to
Anguilla.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. “The Atlantic and Pacific shall prepare to receive
their wilderness and it shall be seen them adorning
as a bride to receive her groom.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. “New animals, new furs, a strange people and
the winter of today shall a used to be.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. “The ice in the north and the ice in the south
shall disappear. Then shall continents which are submerged
arise and the whole earth shall bloom.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. “O Sun, thou outlet of the inter-planetical fumes,
shine on. For with thee, of thee, by thee, he shall sit
in his parlor in Athlyi, Africa, and see his daughter flirting
in Chicago, U. S. A. He shall rebuke her with his
mouth and she shall hear him, then reply with the wave
of her hand and he shall see her.</p>

<p class='c006'>13. “In his parlor he shall see a rooster treading in
the moon and the bees on the roses in Venus.</p>

<p class='c006'>14. “The laborers in Mars, strike-breakers on earth
and my daughter in college in Jupiter.</p>

<p class='c006'>15. “How hard it is when ye know not how, but he
that is in me shall know the mysteries of mysteries
which are hidden from him in these days.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>16. “But I shall feed him with my own hands so
that he takes one bite at a time and one swallow at a
time else he be choked.</p>

<p class='c006'>17. “My boys shall remind you of the things I have
forgotten, for I have seen so far, but those that cometh
after me, of me, with me and upon our God shall see
farther even than I.</p>

<p class='c006'>18. “Verily, Verily, I am the seed,” saith Athlyi,
“but the Lord, God of Ethiopia, is the sower, and ye
are trees of me that shall bring forth fruit a million
fold.</p>

<p class='c006'>19. “But he that beareth not is he that has not me
in his heart and shall therefore receive no reward of
me.</p>

<p class='c006'>20. “I have not reached the height but they that
are of me shall extend me. I have, however, dug deep
and laid the foundation of eternal salvation. I have
made thick the walls. I have sunk deeper the center pillars
and lined them with steel. The reinforcements I
have made of steel for I am conscious of the height
that shall be attained on me. A development beyond
words.</p>

<p class='c006'>21. “I am black. Made in the image and likeness
of the God of our fathers and is of the Lord, our God
unto thee.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>22. “He that establishes himself in me is with God
and dwelleth upon an efficient foundation, but he that
buildeth not on me establishes himself on nothing of

<p class='c006'>23. “La Alpha Elijah cr toco coruse, ninky mose
zezom la jobijem.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 2.<br /> HELD OUT HIS MORSEL.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass that Athlyi sat in the sanctuary
of the House of Athlyi with his left hand under
his chin and the morsel in his right hand, apparently he
was present in person but in the spirit he was not.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. His mind went afar and entered the characteristic
of the human tie.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. Suddenly he stretched forth his morsel and uttered
saying, “Sons of Athlyi, arise! Lift your heads and
take heed. Let the sublimity of my words reign in your
hearts and in the hearts of your offsprings forever.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. “Verily, Verily, I say unto you, poverty is of the
devil but it is better that ye choose to be poor than to
live in the richness of the richest with a woman whose
heart is contrary to thine.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. “The deeds of a contrary couple are destructive
and their destiny is Hell everlasting.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>6. “I plead a divorce, my beloved, because I leadeth
thee south but thou goeth north. I point east but thy
desire is west. Depart therefore that ye find a man who
seeth and goeth in thy own direction that it be well
with thee; for a tug-o-war in the mind is horror to the
soul. Moreover the treasury of the richest is not sufficient
to supply the consumption of the contrary spirit.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. “For a man no height is too high to achieve in
me. No obstacle is too great for him to remove when
conscious that his woman is with him indeed.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Blessed is the household where the couple can map
out the future with patience, peace and understanding,
but a quarrelsome woman is a road to hell. Let so be
said even of the man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>8. And Athlyi reached out his morsel again and
said, “Hear ye, O daughters of Athlyi! Verily I say
unto you, the hopes and salvation of a woman is in the
man, whose trust is in the Lord, our God, in me.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. “But he that is not in me is far from God and
has nothing of consequence for a brag.</p>

<p class='c006'>10. “For I am this rock, the spring and power
grounded in God. Dwell in me, with love and righteousness
in faith, patience, cleanness and constructiveness.
My spirit in thee shall never die.</p>

<p class='c006'>11. “Verily I say unto all nations, the Athlians are
not too proud to sacrifice whatever is necessary to obtain
justice and to establish peace on earth, for where
righteousness is lacking there is no tranquility.</p>

<p class='c006'>12. “Our motto is Peace. Our standard is Right.
Our hopes are Salvation.”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 3.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c005'>1. The spirit of the Lord moved within Athlyi. Being
full with the Holy Ghost the Shepherd spake saying:</p>

<p class='c006'>2. “Thou giveth the fat of thy life to the devil.
Now that thou art drained and can no longer stand,
ye cometh to God with your bones. ‘But I shall not
accept them,’ saith the Lord, ‘for I am God who giveth
thee to eat and to drink. I am he who supplies the
necessities of life. Shall my reward be that ye dump
your garbage on me?’</p>

<p class='c006'>3. “‘Unto him whom thou giveth the fat of thy
life dump also thy bones, that ye bear in fullness the
consequence of your wickedness for the body of the
wicked shall be cast into the grave and his soul in
hell eternal. For the spirit of the body that abideth in
earthly hell shall be a prisoner in hell everlasting’.”</p>

<p class='c006'>4. And the word of the Lord came to Athlyi saying,
‘He that giveth unto me the fat of his life by his
usefulness for the welfare of the living, when I the
Lord shall transform him from this earth, I shall exalt
him into heaven everlasting where he shall live forever
with me in peace and splendor.</p>

<p class='c006'>5. ‘Whosoever I forgive shall rise to serve me, but
whosoever I have not forgiven shall not rise.</p>

<p class='c006'>6. ‘He that passeth away in me shall dwell with my
saints in glory,’ saith the Lord. ‘But the spirit of the
body of him that passeth away in the devil shall not
enter my fold, but shall dwell in everlasting torment.’</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>7. And Athlyi spake saying, “Life without pleasure
within capacity is displeasing to God, but in your
amusements dance ye mild else ye offend the Master.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. “The clean should not accept the invitations of
the unclean to gossip with them for the Lord abideth in
the clean in spirit.”</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER 4.<br /> SHALL SUFFER.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1. And it came to pass that Athlyi spake saying,
“I shall be dragged about, mocked, scorned, and persecuted
because of this gospel, which the Lord, God of
Ethiopia, has commanded unto you through me. Many
of you who follow me this day will desert your Shepherd
because of fear. But blessed are the brave and
faithful. They shall be rulers over rulers.</p>

<p class='c006'>2. “Thine enemy shall shed your blood because of
this Holy Piby, but the blood of thy veins shall richen
the soil for the gospel. I am Messiah unto Ethiopia,
therefore my word shall reign forever and ever.</p>

<p class='c006'>3. “I shall be cast into prison for your sake, but my
spirit shall go out of jail and fight for Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'>4. “Nations shall perish because of my persecution,
for I am not a mere man but a Messiah upon the earth.
Whosoever persecuteth me, committeth a crime against
the holy ghost, in which there is no forgiveness, therefore
the consequence is hell eternal.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>5. “The Athlians, God’s selected people, who are of
never dying faith and perseverence shall increase in
power. Their women shall breed like rabbits and the
Green Pasture shall aid in their protection. Verily the
Athlians shall be numberless upon the earth and the
Spirit of the Lord shall guide them.”</p>

<p class='c006'>6. And Athlyi spake saying, “It shall come to pass
that the devil will make hollow ground in the pathway
of the Athlians, but they shall march upon him with the
Holy Piby and he shall step back and fall into his own
ditch.</p>

<p class='c006'>7. “Verily I say unto you, if a hay stack can stop
a blazing fire then shall the workers of the devil impede
the advancing Athlians whose development has no
boundary, but the mocker shall perish.</p>

<p class='c006'>8. “Thou despiseth me when I was weak, now that
I am strong, ye come?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Verily, verily, neither my milk nor my cream shall
be for thee, but shall be for those who supported me in
my tender age.</p>

<p class='c006'>9. “Yea, it shall be said of Athlyi, ‘In spite of all
obstacles, he climbed with the burdens of Ham, and
when he reached the top, the Heaven and the earth
shouted, Behold! He has conquered, and an angel of
the Lord descended and crowned him.’</p>

<p class='c006'>10. La jobijem dilt ze larky inty met. Zeth Athlyi.</p>

<p class='c006'>A. There is much difference, the holy law to the
Israelites was given to Moses, but God’s holy law given
to the children of Ethiopia was handed to Athlyi by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>messenger of the Lord our God, notwithstanding in the
law given to the Israelites there are ten commandments,
but in the law given to the children of Ethiopia there are
twelve.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q13. What Church is already established on God’s
holy law given to the children of Ethiopia?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. The Afro Athlican Constructive Church.</p>

<p class='c006'>Q14. By what other name shall this church be known?</p>

<p class='c006'>A. The House of Athlyi.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>THE SHEPHERD’S COMMAND BY ATHLYI.</h3>

<p class='c005'>1st. Let all literature for the instruction of Athlian’s
children be of a constructive nature, looking toward
Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c006'>2nd. Let the eye of a star be the eye of the Shepherd
and the ear of a star be the ear of the Shepherd, for they
are his stars.</p>

<p class='c006'>3rd. Fight for that which is yours and ye shall obtain
it, for there is nothing hard against the power of God.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
